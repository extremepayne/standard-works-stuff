Unofficial; python programs relating to the standard works of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

## Notice
This program does not express the official views of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, nor is it endorsed or supported in any way by the aforementioned Church. These scriptures are not in any way guaranteed to be the most recent version or even canonical scripture, but for your convenience, a link to the Church's website (which does have the most recent/canonical version) is provided with every scripture.

## Acknowledgments
This project depends on the [LDS documentation Project](https://github.com/mormon-documentation-project/lds-scriptures), and since that project is in the public domain, the JSON file of the scriptures is packaged directly into this repo. In the same spirit of goodwill, I chose to use a public domain license for this project as well.
